## Introduction

Machine learning is a vital part of artificial intelligence. It allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This repository provides a hands-on approach to understanding machine learning concepts by building projects from the ground up.

You can explore various machine learning topics and implement them yourself. This way, you not only learn the theory but also gain practical experience. 

To see the latest updates and releases, visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/dhsbkd/build-your-own-x-machine-learning/releases).

## Topics Covered

This repository includes a wide range of topics in machine learning:

- **Linear Regression**: Understand the basics of regression and how to implement it.
- **Logistic Regression**: Learn about classification problems and how logistic regression solves them.
- **Decision Trees**: Build decision trees and understand their structure and function.
- **Random Forests**: Dive into ensemble methods and learn how random forests improve accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines**: Explore the concept of hyperplanes and margins.
- **Neural Networks**: Understand the architecture of neural networks and how they function.
- **Deep Learning**: Learn about deep learning techniques and frameworks.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Explore the latest advancements in natural language processing.
